						<h3>HackRU is non-stop fun!</h3>
						<p id="about">Close to a thousand hackers will come together to envision, create, and demo their own unique application. At the start of the hackathon, our sponsoring companies will 
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank">present their technologies</a>. Use these technologies in your applications to accelerate your hacking to the cutting edge. Throughout the day, you will be surrounded by mentors from our sponsors and fellow hackers who will help you hack like a rock star. At the end of 24 hours, we will all assemble with a panel of judges and award awesome prizes.  Everyone will get fed, receive sweet swag, and meet amazing people.  HackRU will be an <br><em>incredible experience.</p>
